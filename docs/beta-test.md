The beta-test period on GUILDNET is starting, and we need a lot of help from the guild and the great NEAR community.

### Will contributors be rewarded?

Yes, G-SKASH (The governance token) will be awarded to collaborators. Your G-SKASH will be awarded to your account during div-pool mainnet implementation.

### What will be the value of a G-SKASH on mainnet?

It's not clear now. It depend on the final tokenomics, it depends on the funding the div-pool attracts, and the future G-SKASH demand.
